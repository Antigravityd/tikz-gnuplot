* Style Files for Gnuplot-Latex Interop

Gnuplot with  =set terminal tikz=  outputs Latex code for which one needs a package generated by calling a Lua script buried in the Gnuplot source tree. This repo includes the three files necessary for  $\TeX$ and $\LaTeX$ interpretation of so-generated plots to aid in packaging the software for GNU Guix.

* Reproduction

#+begin_src shell

  git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/gnuplot/gnuplot-main gnuplot-gnuplot-main
  cd gnuplot-gnuplot-main/term/lua
  lua gnuplot-tikz.lua style

#+end_src

The current files were taken from Gnuplot commit e156a52ce9a101427b26afff2ef5cf8b5e43a319, and have been minimally tested with gnuplot 5.4.3 and texlive 20210325
